# SPAM-EMAIL-DETECTION

This project focuses on building a Spam Email Detection system using Machine Learning techniques to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). With the rapid increase in unwanted and malicious emails, this model helps in automatically filtering spam messages and improving email security and user experience.

The system preprocesses raw email text by performing data cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (using techniques such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF). Multiple machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to identify the most effective model for spam classification.
